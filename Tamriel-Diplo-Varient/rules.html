<p>The Tamriel Varient explores the possibility of a second great war on the continent in the 202nd year of the 4th era. The varient is supposed to be a balanced 6 player map, and while the most care has been taken to stick to real in-universe borders, in some cases the borders have deviated in the interest of enjoyment and balance.</p>

<p><b>General Notes:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>The supply centers Eli, Tan and Rih were historically allied with Hammerfell. However, to improve the balance of the map, they start off the game neutral.</li>
<li>There is one case in which an island bordering the mainland can be traversed by armies: Khe<=>Pel. Tel does not border Fir</li>
<li>A number of mainland territories contain traversable waters and may be occupied by a fleet. They are analagous to Kiel and Constantinople in Classic Diplomacy.</li>
<li>These territories are: Imperial city (Imp), Nibenay (Nib), Leyawiin (Ley), Blacklight (Bla), Stonehills (Sto), Ascadia (Asc), Firewatch (Fir), and Helstrom (Hel)</li>
<li>Treat these territories, as well as islands, as regular coasts. A fleet within them may not convoy an army.</li>
